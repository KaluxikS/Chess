# Chess (still in progress)
This is a simple chess implemented in Python. It allows users to play chess by making moves on the chessboard. In future chess engine will be implemented

Description
----
The chessengine.py file contains the implementation of the GameState class, which represents the state of the chess game. It includes methods for making moves, undoing moves, getting valid moves, checking for checkmate and stalemate, and determining if a square is under attack. It also includes move functions for each type of chess piece.

The chessmain.py file handles user input and displays the chessboard using the pygame library. It loads the images for the chess pieces and allows users to click on squares to make moves.

Usage
----
To use the chess engine, follow these steps:

1. Install the pygame library.
2. Download the chessengine.py and chessmain.py files.
3. Run the chessmain.py file using Python.
4. Upon running the program, a window will open displaying the chessboard. You can click on a piece to select it, and then click on a valid square to move the piece. The program will print the chess notation of the move in the console.
